            ## 📱 Main Chat Interface

            ### Interacting with Messages

            *   **Speak AI Response**: Tap the **speaker icon** to speak out loud the AI's response(Up to 3900 characters.) Will not display if your device's text-to-speech engine isn't available.
            *   **Create PDF of Response**: Tap the **pdf icon** to save just that response as a PDF in your device's Downloads folder.
            *   **Edit User Message**: Tap the **edit icon** on a user message to load its text into the input box for editing. Caution: this removes the message and all subsequent messages from the history.
            *   **Resend User Message**: Tap the **resend icon** on a user message to resend the prompt and generate a new response. Caution: this removes all messages after it while keeping the original prompt.

            ### Sending Prompts
            *   **Text Box**: Enter your prompt.
            *   **Send Button**: Send your prompt to the LLM. **Long-press** it to open the Presets screen.
            *   **Stop Button**: During an api call, tap the Stop Button to end the api call.
            *   **Image Button**: Appears for vision models. Click icon to attach a single image or take picture up to 12MB in size. Long-click goes straight to camera. 
            *   **Palette Button**: If using Nano-Banana, tap to set aspect ratio of returned generated image.
            
            ### Other Buttons
            *   **Clear Chat**(button on bottom left): Starts a new chat with the current model. Long-press to start a new chat without a warning alert.
            *   **System Message Button**: Opens your library of system messages. If you currently are on a non-default System Message you can long-press and it will auto switch to your default.
            *   **Saved Chats**: Opens a list of your saved conversations.
            *   **Save Chat**: Saves the chat. You can name it yourself or let the AI (qwen/qwen3-30b-a3b-instruct-2507 is used) generate a title. Only text chats can be saved.
            
            ---

            ##  Menu

            Tap the **menu button** (the one on the lower left with nine dots) to show or hide the main menu. The menu will also hide if you tap outside of it.
            If your prompt is filled with spelling/grammar errors you can long-press the menu button to send the prompt to model "mistralai/mistral-small-3.2-24b-instruct" to fix it and it will automatically correct the prompt in the prompt box.

            ### Contextual Buttons (Enabled during a chat)
            *   **PDF Button**: Creates a PDF of the entire chat in your downloads folder.
            *   **Copy Chat**: Copies the full conversation to your clipboard. Long Press to copy Markdown RAW.

            ### Standard Buttons (Always in the menu)
            *   **Stream Button**: Toggles streaming responses on or off.
            *   **Reasoning Button**: Appears only for models that support reasoning. Toggles reasoning on or off. When enabled, the model uses deeper thinking for more thoughtful responses. When disabled, it explicitly instructs the model not to use reasoning. Reasoning traces are not returned in the response. Defaults to medium effort. If you long-press on the button if it is selected, you can enable Advanced Reasoning settings(see below). 
            *   **Max Tokens Button**: Opens a dialog to set your Max Tokens value. Max Tokens limit the length of the AI's response. A higher number allows longer replies but may increase costs. Default is 12000.
            *   **API Key Button**: Opens a dialog to enter your OpenRouter API key. **Long-press** to check your remaining credits.
            *   **Notification Button**: Activates a foreground service to prevent the app from closing in the background and enables you to customize the notification.
            *   **Extended Dock Button**: Toggles extended dock on or off. If on, an extra row is added to the bottom dock. On the right is a Paste button, which when pressed pastes the contents of your clipboard to the prompt box; When long-pressed, pastes the clipboard to the prompt box and auto-sends it to your selected model. On the left is either a Speech-to-Text button when the prompt box is empty, or a Clear Prompt button when the prompt box has some text.
            *   **Conversation Button**: Toggles "Audio Conversation" mode on or off. When enabled, Speech-to-Text automatically sends recognized prompts to the model, and responses are automatically read aloud via Text-to-Speech.
            *   **Biometric Button**: Toggles fingerprint biometric security on or off. If on, the app will not open without a successful fingerprint reading by the system. 
            *   **Presets Button**: Opens the Presets screen. These enable the user to have pre-selected settings applied to the app: model, system message, reasoning on/off, streaming on/off, and conversation mode on/off, with one tap. These are also exposed as a share target, "Presets", when sharing text to the app; thus making functions like summarization, spelling correction, audio reply, etc with different models/combos fast and easy. Note: because the user can change the model and system message outside the preset, if they are to do that, it will invalidate the preset(it won't apply) and will require the user to edit/save the preset again with the current desired model/system message for it to work.
            *   **Fonts Button**: Opens the fonts dialog where you can choose one of many different fonts for the main chat screen.
            ---
