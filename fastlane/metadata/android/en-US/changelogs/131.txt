- Added a copy button target for Prompt Library items(tapping on item also copies). After copy, user is now taken directly back to main chat screen.
- Fix: Timeout reduced to 10 seconds for screen that lists LAN models. Backing out stops the request and won't crash the app.
- Corrected some small button spacing issues.
